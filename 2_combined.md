## · Cashback Earn Illustration

If the customer spends Rs. 50,000 in a billing cycle with the following break up of spends -

- o Flipkart: Rs. 10,000 | Preferred Merchants: Rs. 5,000 | Other spends: Rs. 35,000
- o Out of these 'Other spends', Rs. 10,000 was an EMI purchase.
- o Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be Rs. 10,000 + Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 25000 + Rs 10,000 (EMI transaction) -Rs. 10,000 (EMI conversion) = Rs. 40,000

The cashback for the billing cycle in example would be calculated as follows:

- o 5% of Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 500
- o 4% of Rs. 5,000 = Rs. 200
- o 1% of Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 250

Thus, the total cashback for the example would be Rs. 500+200+250 = Rs. 950

## · Cashback Capping Scenario

- Maximum cashback that the customer can earn in a statement quarter per merchant (Flipkart, Myntra and Cleartrip) is INR 4000.
- Statement quarter is defined basis your statement date. For e.g. if your statement date is 15 th of every month, then:
- o 1 st Quarter:16 th March-15 th June
- o 2 nd Quarter: 16 th June-15 th September
- o 3 rd Quarter:16 th September-15 th  December
- o 4 th Quarter:16 th December-15 th March

Below is an illustration of the cashback that can be earned in the calendar quarter Mar-June:

|                    |           | Transaction amount (in INR)   | Cashback%   | Cashback earned (in INR)   |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 16 March- 15 April | Flipkart  | 20,000                        | 5.0%        | 1,000                      |

| 16 April- 15 May   | Cleartrip | 90,000                        | 5.0%        | 4,000**                    |
| 16 April- 15 May   | Myntra    | 1,000                         | 7.5%        | 75                         |
|                    | Flipkart  | 30,000                        | 5.0%        | 1,000*                     |
|                    | Cleartrip | 6,000                         | 5.0%        | 0                          |

| Statement Quarter   |           | Total Cashback earned (in INR)   |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 16 March- 15 June   | Flipkart  | 4,000*                           |
| 16 March- 15 June   | Cleartrip | 4,000**                          |
| 16 March- 15 June   | Myntra    | 450                              |

* 5% Cashback earned on spends on Flipkart in June is INR 1,000 as the maximum cashback that can be earned in a calendar quarter for spends on this merchant is INR 4,000.
- ** 5% Cashback earned on spends on Cleartrip in May is INR 4,000 as the maximum cashback that can be earned in a calendar quarter for spends on this merchant is INR 4,000.
- Treatment of Cashback Surplus.
- A surplus of cashback will be maintained for adjustments of EMI conversions or transaction refunds.
- The surplus maintained for Flipkart, Myntra and Cleartrip will be separate and will not be used for adjustments between these merchants.
- The surplus that is remaining at the end of the statement quarter will be written off and each new quarter will be a fresh cycle.
- Surplus for the previous quarter will however be considered only in case of EMI conversions done in subsequent quarters of the original transaction since transaction can be converted into EMI for upto 60 days post the original transaction.
- ** 5% cashback earned on Cleartrip on May transaction of INR 90,000 amounts to INR 4500, since INR 4000 is the permitted cashback in a quarter the additional INR 500 gets added to the surplus. Additional cashback of INR 300 earned in the June transaction gets accumulated to the surplus. When an EMI conversion is made for INR 6000 on Cleartrip no cashback gets debited as there is sufficient surplus to settle this conversion. In case there are no adjustments (EMI or Merchant Refund) in the next quarter the surplus amount of 500 in quarter 1 will get written off at the end of the quarter 2.
- ***7.5% cashback earned on Myntra on transaction done on April May and June adds up to a total cashback of INR 450. Since this is within the permitted cap there is no amount that gets added to the surplus. When an EMI conversion is done for INR 3000 a debit entry of INR 225 is posted. This the total cashback earned for Myntra for the quarter becomes INR 225.
- Non-customer-initiated  payment/credit  such  as  cashback/charge  reversals  etc.  received  into  the credit  card  account  will not be  considered  as  a  payment  towards  the  outstanding  of  the  card. However, such credits will be considered to compute the subsequent month's dues.
- Cashback earned for the purchases during the current billing cycle will be credited in the next billing cycle 3 days prior to the statement generation date i.e. if the statement date is 15 th Feb, cashback earned in the Feb month cycle (16 th Jan-15 th Feb) will be credited on 12 th March.
- Cashback earned will be computed based on spends during the statement period minus any returns, refunds, or EMI conversion during the same period.
- In case the purchase/ transaction is returned/ cancelled/ reversed post statement generation date, cashback toward such transactions will be debited on the date of such purchase/ transaction reversal.

- In case of conversion of a transaction to EMI at a later date, cashback earned on such transaction will be reversed during the same billing cycle as EMI conversion.
- In case the customer reverses a transaction, the corresponding cashback earned on the transaction will also be reversed and in case the customer has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees &amp; charges as per the schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
- For EMI transactions made using FLIPKART AXIS BANK Credit Card which have later been cancelled at merchant site, customer must also cancel the EMI by calling our Phone Banking team on 1800 103 5577 (toll-free) before the first EMI is debited, to avoid an excess reversal of cashback.
- If a Cardholder's Flipkart Axis Bank credit card is terminated at any time for any reason, whether by the  primary  Cardholder  or  the  Bank,  the  primary  Cardholder  will  forthwith  be  disqualified  from earning  the  Cash  backs  and  all  unused  Cash  backs  then  accrued  shall  automatically  be  forfeited immediately after voluntary or involuntary cancellation of the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card.
- Any remaining cashback including cashbacks pending credit into the account of the Cardholder shall immediately cease to be valid upon the occurrence of the following:
-  The cancellation of the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card; or
-  The conversion of the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card to any other Axis Bank credit card
-  In the event of a default i.e. if the Minimum Amount Due is not paid by the Payment Due Date or
-  Breach of any clause of the Card Member Agreement

And no refund, extension or compensation shall be given by Axis Bank even if the card member's membership is reinstated.

- The Credit Card is issued for personal expenses and purposes only. The Cardholder must not use the Credit Card to purchase anything for resale, for commercial or business purposes.

- If the Credit Card is found to be used for prohibited, restricted, commercial purposes or any purposes as mentioned above, Axis Bank may, at its sole discretion, exercise its right to cancel the concerned Credit Card and additional/add-on cards thereof and withhold/cancel the Cashback earned, without any notice to the Cardholder. Axis Bank may enquire with you over phone or through any other means of formal communication and seek details, information, proofs, etc., about the Credit Card transactions, pattern of usage, etc. Non- satisfactory responses or no responses from the Cardholder may lead to blocking/closure of the Credit Card by Axis Bank
- Use of the Card at Merchant Establishment will be limited by the credit limit assigned to each Card Account by the Bank.
- The  Bank  may,  at  any  time  without  prior  notice,  or  stating  any  reason  whatsoever,  refuse authorization for a Charge at a Merchant Establishment, and / or restrict or defer the Card member's ability to use the Card and / or suspend or cancel the Card. The Bank through the ATM, Merchant Establishment, by itself may repossess / retain the Credit Card, if it reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for proper management of credit or business risk, or if the Card or Card Account is being misused or likely to be misused.

- Since  there  is  no  cashback  on  EMI  transactions,  once  a  transaction  is  converted  into  EMI,  the customer will not earn any cashback on the transaction even if the customer opts for foreclosure or cancellation of the EMI and pays the full amount on the same.
- For customers who wish to foreclose their EMI transactions, customers would need to call up Axis Bank customer care and place a request for the same.
- The cashback will be rounded down for each individual transaction. For e.g., If for a transaction of Rs. 1180, the customer is eligible for a cashback of 1% i.e., 1180 * 1% = Rs. 11.8. Only Rs. 11 will be credited to the customer for that individual transaction.
- Axis  Bank  will  send  estatements  as  per  the  details  updated  in  Bank's  records.  Non  receipt  of statement would not impact the obligation and liability for the customer under this agreement and shall be liable to settle the outstanding balance on the card within the payment due date.
