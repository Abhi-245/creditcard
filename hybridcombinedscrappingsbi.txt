Use your Credit Card wisely
Credit cards come with legal contracts. Hence, it is important that you are aware of their terms and conditions, when you sign up for them.
Explore features and learn about T&Cs:
Please read your credit card application carefully to know about your card’s features and associated Terms and Conditions. The information mentioned in small prints may have big impacts on your fee, charges and usage conditions. While some T&Cs are similar on all cards, there are many others that may be particular to the ones you are applying for, so we recommend that you go through all of them.
Understand liabilities:
If your card has multiple users, know about the liabilities shared by secondary users. Also, if you have applied for
Add-on cards
, understand the added responsibilities that come with them such as who will manage the cards, pay bills and debts, etc.
Read more
Know how to cancel your Credit Card:
Knowing how to cancel your card is as important as knowing how to use it. When you decide to close a Credit Card, make sure all payments have been made and there are no pending dues. Avoid closing cards that still have outstanding balance to be cleared or those that make a significant amount of your credit history. Cancelling such cards impact your credit score.
Learn about cash advances:
Credit Cards give you the freedom of taking cash advances. But avail this service only at the time of emergency because cash advances are levied with charges, which you start paying from the day you have taken the advance. There is no grace period on cash advances from a credit card.
Exploring lower rate of interest options for payments:
In case of unexpected expenses, it is better to talk to your credit card company and explore different options that you can take advantage of, such as availing low interest credit options. This way you can save on the amount you repay.
Tips for secure Card usage
Credit cards give you a lot of power and if you follow some crucial mantras about their usage, you can harness them well.
Ensure the safety of your Credit Card, PIN number, Card expiry date, CVV(security code) by all means. Also, Please do not share your One Time Password(OTP) with anyone. Always get your current contact number updated to ensure receipt of transaction alerts. Whenever you travel abroad, please stay informed about the benefits you can avail in case of card loss or theft, such
Card Insurance plans
& Emergency Card replacement services.
Be vigilant and check your credit card statements/transaction alert SMS carefully for any suspicious transaction(s). If you ever notice any unsolicited transaction, immediately report the same.

Avail
credit cards
from institutions that follow national & international standards for secure transactions
Do not hand-over your credit card to people, whom you do not know. When you shop, make sure that the card is not out of your sight and you have collected your card at the end of the transaction. Also, before signing the charge slip, check the amount printed on it.
Keep your Credit Card, CVV and helpline numbers saved with you separately and in case of card loss or theft, immediately inform your card issuer and get the card blocked.
Always log in into your credit card account from a secure computer that is malware free. Make a strong password(combination of Upper case, numbers & special characters) for the online account of your credit card and do not share your password with anyone.
Refrain from responding to correspondences that asks for your Credit Card number, expiry date, CVV or password/OTP details. Banks or your card issuer, will never ask for this information from you. Whenever you get such mails, calls, SMS, etc. bring them to the notice of your card issuer.

Credit Score
Credit Score is a 3-digit number, which represents your credit history based on your credit behavior. The Credit score ranges between 300 - 900. High score implies a good credit history. A score below 600 is poor, whereas ideally score greater than 750 is the best.
As per RBI guidelines, SBI Card regularly submits credit information of all cardholders to respective bureaus on a regular basis. Some major bureaus include:
CIBIL Transunion
Experian
CRIF Highmark
Equifax

Importance of Credit Score
When you apply for a loan or credit card, the lending/issuing company checks your credit score first to determine if you are eligible to avail the loan or get a credit card.
Higher is the score better are your application approval chance. Low score places you in a Risk Zone and makes it difficult to secure an approval.
Some of the factors affecting your Credit Score
Irregular payments of your dues:
Ensure timely payments of your monthly credit card dues to maintain good credit history and high score.
Over- utilization of your credit limit:
Usage of credit card balance above credit limit affect credit score negatively.
Partial payments:
Making partial payments of your monthly credit dues/outstanding bills.

HOW TO GET CASH FROM AN ATM
Now you don’t need to enter a bank anymore. The power to access cash at the press of 
a key is in your hands 24 hours a day. To access cash from any Visa ATMs, all you have 
to do is:
• Insert your card into the machine as directed and wait till the machine prompts you 
to key in your Personal Identification Number (PIN).
• Wait for a few seconds till the machine processes this PIN. It will then ask you to key 
in the amount of cash you need. 
• Wait for a few seconds till your card comes out, count your cash before you leave.
SAFETY TIPS FOR ATM USAGE
• As soon as you get your PIN, memorise it and destroy the PIN mailer. Do not write 
the PIN on your card and never share it with anyone. Not even with our staff. Only 
you must know your PIN.
• Do not let anybody use your card to access the ATM facility on your behalf.
• Your PIN cannot be changed. Incase you forget it, please call the SBI Card Helpline 
and ask for it to be re-issued to you.
PLEASE NOTE:
• Your PIN along with your card is the only requirement for using this facility. Anyone in possession of 
both can use it to withdraw cash from the ATM.
• Please follow the instructions on the ATM carefully.
• It is important that you respond to the instructions on the ATM in reasonable time.
• In case you do not act after keying in the PIN, your card will either be retained by the machine or else 
will be ejected.
• Your card, if retained by the machine, will have to be re-issued and this is subject to a replacement 
card fee at the prevailing rate.
• The ATM may disburse currency notes of a particular denomination only.

Using your CASHBACK SBI Card is very simple. Once you have made a purchase at any 
of the merchant establishments that display the Visa sign, please present your card for 
payment
The establishment will prepare a charge slip (specimen shown above), very much like a 
normal bill, which contains the details of the transaction.
• Please verify the amount  A  and ensure that other particulars on your charge slip 
are correct. 
• Kindly add the amount paid as tips and 
miscellaneous expenses and ensure that 
the total amount is filled. Check the 
amount in words (never leave the total 
blank).
• Please sign on the charge slip at the 
place indicated  B  in the same way as 
you have signed on the reverse of your 
card. You will be returned a copy of the 
charge slip, the actual bill and your 
card. 
• Before you leave, please ensure that 
you have received your card.
• The amount you spend on your card will 
appear in your monthly statement. You 
can make your CASHBACK SBI Card 
payment using any of the 14 payment 
options available. Normal use of card 
does not attract any transaction fee or 
interest charge except in case of late 
payment / no payment.HOW TO USE YOUR CASHBACK SBI Card?

CASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’sCASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’s9

10 CASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’S
Look Wave Go1.  What is CASHBACK SBI Card?
Ans:  CASHBACK SBI Card powered by Visa contactless technology is a fast and con-
venient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless chip tech-
nology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and give you the 
freedom to do the things that matter most to you.
2. How does the CASHBACK SBI Card work?
Ans: Step 1: Look for the Visa contactless technology mark and contactless logo at 
the point of sale.
 Step 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount 
will be displayed on the contactless reader.
 Step 3: Hold your card over the reader at close range (less than 4 cm from where 
the contactless logo appears).
 Step 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate when the 
transaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen 
indicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required. 
 Please note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum 
 of `5000 for a single transaction.
3.  What are the benefits?
Ans: Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa is specially designed for you 
for speed, convenience and security. During a contactless transaction the card 
never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud 
through counterfeit/ skimming. A Visa contactless card has its own, unique, 
built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa 
contactless transaction, thus making it more secure. There’s no dipping, swiping 
or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places 
like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatre etc. You don’t need to look for 
cash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of 
these expenses.

11
4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own limit?
Ans: Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a limit of maximum `5000 
for a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required. 
 This limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limit is not 
possible. Any transaction amount more than `5000 has to be carried out through
 Look, Wave, Go, a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You 
can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for 
transactions amount below `5000.
5. Where can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card ?
Ans: You can look for the Universal Contactless symbol at the Point of Sale machine 
at merchant outlets. Also, please visit sbicard.com for details of merchants 
enabled for Visa contactless payment acceptance.
6. Can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card at other merchants (not enabled or contact-
less payment acceptance) as well?
Ans: Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can 
use this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.
7.  Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?
Ans: No, as contactless readers will only communicate with one card at a time. If the 
shop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you  
will be asked to select one card to pay.
8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?
Ans: No. Your card has to be waved within 4 cm of the card reader for more than half 
a second and the retailer must have first entered the amount for you to approve.  
Terminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore 
reducing transaction errors.
9. Is there any difference in the process for ATM and Internet transactions for the 
CASHBACK SBI Card?
Ans: There is no difference in transaction process for ATM or any Card not present 
transactions including internet transactions. For ATM transactions you need to 
enter the PIN and for Internet transaction you need to enter your 3D secure PIN 
or OTP.

16 USE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY
While you are empowered to use your credit card the way you wish to, it is best to use 
it responsibly.  As credit card mismanagement is on the rise various financial institu-
tions in the country have set up CIBIL, a body to monitor credit usage and safeguard 
the interests of member banks and financial institutions. Here is how an ideal credit 
cycle works: 
WHAT IS CREDIT INFORMATION BUREAU INDIA LIMITED (CIBIL)?
CIBIL is India’s first credit information bureau established in 2004. It is a repository of 
information which contains the credit history of all borrowers CIBIL’s members include 
all leading banks, financial institutions,non-banking financial companies, housing 
finance companies, state financial corporations and credit card companies.You borrow

Ideal Credit Cycle
WHAT IS A CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT?
A Credit Information Report (CIR) is a factual record of a borrower’s credit payment 
history compiled from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose 
is to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and 
objectively.
HOW DOES THE CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT IMPACT ME?
When you approach the Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will 
be evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other 
factors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit 
being granted faster and on better terms.
On the other hand, a poor past payment record indicate past delinquency and can lead 
to denial of credit or extremely expensive credit.
Therefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a 
good credit history for enabling you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit 
in the future.
HOW DO I IMPROVE MY CREDIT RECORD?
• Make at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will 
have the most positive significant impact on your credit record.
• Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit
• Limit the number of credit cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards 
can hurt your credit history.
• Do not use your credit card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit 
limit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.17
DO’S
• Make your credit card payments on time
• Pay off your “Minimum Amount Due” on your card every month
• Contact your creditors if you are having trouble making payments
• Make sure that your monthly account statement is correct
• Read the statements and other material you receive from your credit card company 
carefully
• Deal with companies you know and trust
• Pay attention to late payments, calls or letters from credit agencies, and denied or 
revoked credit. These are all signs that your credit history may be in jeopardy!
DON’TS
• Do not pay late
• Do not sign a credit contract until you read and understand it
• Don’t go over the credit limit on your credit card
• Don’t wait to report any unauthorized transactions on your account
• Don’t open new credit accounts for the purpose of debit consolidation without clos-

event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

 - Encash
 - ATM Withdrawals

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

liable to SBICPSL for all the Charges even though the monthly statement of account may be sent only 
to the Primary Cardholder. The Primary Cardholder may at any time request cancellation of any 
Additional Card(s) but will continue to remain liable for any Charges on such Additional Card(s).
3. USE OF THE CARD
3.1 The Card is valid for use in India and internationally as per usage restrictions, entitlements and other 
conditions stipulated by Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) or any other Government authority from time to 
time.

instance of RBI or SBICPSL.
3.4 Use of the Card at Merchant Establishments will be limited by the credit limit assigned to each Card 
Account by SBICPSL from time to time. In case of Additional Cards issued by SBICPSL, the extent of 
use of all Cards so issued will be limited by the Card Account’s credit limit. The Outstanding on the 
Card Account must not exceed the credit limit at any time. In the event of breach of this provision, the 
Cardholder will be charged an over limit fee at the prevailing rate. The Cardholder must repay the 
excess immediately. The over limit fee is subject to change at the discretion of SBICPSL. The credit limit 
may be revised from time to time at the discretion of SBICPSL.
3.5 SBICPSL may, at any time without prior notice, refuse authorisation for a Charge incurred at a 
Merchant Establishment, and/or restrict or defer the Cardholder’s ability to use the Card and/or 
suspend or cancel the Card and/or repossess (directly or through a Merchant Establishment or any 
other third party) the Card if it reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for proper management 
of credit or business risk or if the Card or the Card Account is being or likely to be misused or if the 
Cardholder is in violation of the exchange control/management regulations or any other applicable law 
or regulation.
3.6 The Card may be used for personal purposes and for bona fide business expenses.3.7 The Cardholder shall ensure that he/she maintains a detailed record of his/her transactions on the 
Internet. SBICPSL is not obliged to make any independent verification with regard to order details 
provided by the Cardholder and shall be entitled to rely on the details submitted by the Cardholder on 
the Internet.
3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The 
Cardholder must retain his/her own copy of the charge slips. Copies of charge slips will not normally 
be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.
3.10 In relation to Charges on account of mail order or telephone or electronic commerce (e.g. on the 
Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the 
concerned Merchant Establishment.
3.11 Any charge slip or other payment requisition (electronic or otherwise) received from a Merchant 
Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount 
recorded on such charge slip or other requisition was properly incurred by the use of the Card by the 
Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.
3.12 You agree that an electronic record or printout of an electronic record or a copy produced from a 
microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account 
with SBICPSL or produced from data received by SBICPSL electronically from the Merchant 
Establishment or from you or any intermediary, shall be conclusive evidence of that document or 
Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.
3.17 The onus of complying with the foreign exchange control/management regulations, baggage rules, 
EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder 
and the Cardholder and shall indemnify and hold harmless SBICPSL from any consequence, loss, 
damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

relation to the insurance cover shall be addressed to and resolved directly by the Cardholder with the 
insurance company.

reason, the benefit of such insurance cover shall automatically and ipso facto cease to be available 
from the date of suspension/cancellation of the Card Account.

Outstanding on his/her Card Account before payment of any compensation or claim to his/her heirs, 
nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

whatsoever, to the information and statements of account sent to him/her via e-mail. Failure on the

the Charge on the basis of his/her own record of the transaction or earlier if requested by SBICPSL.

any credit received from the Merchant Establishments in favour of the Cardholder. When the Card 
Account has a debit(s) or a credit(s) to be applied over a statement period as determined by SBICPSL 
from time to time, SBICPSL will send a monthly statement of account to the Cardholder reflecting such 
debit(s)/credit(s). The Cardholder’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement will not be 
affected in any way by non-receipt of the monthly statement of account and the Cardholder shall be

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351

(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

liable to SBICPSL for all the Charges even though the monthly statement of account may be sent only 
to the Primary Cardholder. The Primary Cardholder may at any time request cancellation of any 
Additional Card(s) but will continue to remain liable for any Charges on such Additional Card(s).
3. USE OF THE CARD

conditions stipulated by Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) or any other Government authority from time to 
time.

instance of RBI or SBICPSL.
3.4 Use of the Card at Merchant Establishments will be limited by the credit limit assigned to each Card 
Account by SBICPSL from time to time. In case of Additional Cards issued by SBICPSL, the extent of 
use of all Cards so issued will be limited by the Card Account’s credit limit. The Outstanding on the 
Card Account must not exceed the credit limit at any time. In the event of breach of this provision, the 
Cardholder will be charged an over limit fee at the prevailing rate. The Cardholder must repay the 
excess immediately. The over limit fee is subject to change at the discretion of SBICPSL. The credit limit 
may be revised from time to time at the discretion of SBICPSL.
3.5 SBICPSL may, at any time without prior notice, refuse authorisation for a Charge incurred at a 
Merchant Establishment, and/or restrict or defer the Cardholder’s ability to use the Card and/or 
suspend or cancel the Card and/or repossess (directly or through a Merchant Establishment or any 
other third party) the Card if it reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for proper management 
of credit or business risk or if the Card or the Card Account is being or likely to be misused or if the 
Cardholder is in violation of the exchange control/management regulations or any other applicable law 
or regulation.
3.6 The Card may be used for personal purposes and for bona fide business expenses.3.7 The Cardholder shall ensure that he/she maintains a detailed record of his/her transactions on the 
Internet. SBICPSL is not obliged to make any independent verification with regard to order details 
provided by the Cardholder and shall be entitled to rely on the details submitted by the Cardholder on 
the Internet.
3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The 
Cardholder must retain his/her own copy of the charge slips. Copies of charge slips will not normally 
be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.
3.10 In relation to Charges on account of mail order or telephone or electronic commerce (e.g. on the 
Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the 
concerned Merchant Establishment.
3.11 Any charge slip or other payment requisition (electronic or otherwise) received from a Merchant 
Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount 
recorded on such charge slip or other requisition was properly incurred by the use of the Card by the 
Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.
3.12 You agree that an electronic record or printout of an electronic record or a copy produced from a 
microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account 
with SBICPSL or produced from data received by SBICPSL electronically from the Merchant 
Establishment or from you or any intermediary, shall be conclusive evidence of that document or 
Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.
3.17 The onus of complying with the foreign exchange control/management regulations, baggage rules, 
EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder 
and the Cardholder and shall indemnify and hold harmless SBICPSL from any consequence, loss, 
damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

from time to time, SBICPSL will send a monthly statement of account to the Cardholder reflecting such 
debit(s)/credit(s). The Cardholder’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement will not be

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any 
scenario)
 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

management regulations. Moreover, the Cardholder may be debarred from holding the Card at the 
instance of RBI or SBICPSL.
3.4 Use of the Card at Merchant Establishments will be limited by the credit limit assigned to each Card 
Account by SBICPSL from time to time. In case of Additional Cards issued by SBICPSL, the extent of 
use of all Cards so issued will be limited by the Card Account’s credit limit. The Outstanding on the 
Card Account must not exceed the credit limit at any time. In the event of breach of this provision, the 
Cardholder will be charged an over limit fee at the prevailing rate. The Cardholder must repay the 
excess immediately. The over limit fee is subject to change at the discretion of SBICPSL. The credit limit 
may be revised from time to time at the discretion of SBICPSL.
3.5 SBICPSL may, at any time without prior notice, refuse authorisation for a Charge incurred at a 
Merchant Establishment, and/or restrict or defer the Cardholder’s ability to use the Card and/or 
suspend or cancel the Card and/or repossess (directly or through a Merchant Establishment or any 
other third party) the Card if it reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for proper management 
of credit or business risk or if the Card or the Card Account is being or likely to be misused or if the 
Cardholder is in violation of the exchange control/management regulations or any other applicable law 
or regulation.
3.6 The Card may be used for personal purposes and for bona fide business expenses.3.7 The Cardholder shall ensure that he/she maintains a detailed record of his/her transactions on the 
Internet. SBICPSL is not obliged to make any independent verification with regard to order details 
provided by the Cardholder and shall be entitled to rely on the details submitted by the Cardholder on 
the Internet.
3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The 
Cardholder must retain his/her own copy of the charge slips. Copies of charge slips will not normally 
be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.
3.10 In relation to Charges on account of mail order or telephone or electronic commerce (e.g. on the 
Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the 
concerned Merchant Establishment.
3.11 Any charge slip or other payment requisition (electronic or otherwise) received from a Merchant 
Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount 
recorded on such charge slip or other requisition was properly incurred by the use of the Card by the 
Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.
3.12 You agree that an electronic record or printout of an electronic record or a copy produced from a 
microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account 
with SBICPSL or produced from data received by SBICPSL electronically from the Merchant 
Establishment or from you or any intermediary, shall be conclusive evidence of that document or 
Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.
3.17 The onus of complying with the foreign exchange control/management regulations, baggage rules, 
EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder 
and the Cardholder and shall indemnify and hold harmless SBICPSL from any consequence, loss, 
damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

from time to time, SBICPSL will send a monthly statement of account to the Cardholder reflecting such

(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any 
scenario)
 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350
All identification of eligible and non-eligible transactions regarding Card Cashback by SBICPL are on best 
effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the 
corresponding cashback earned on the transaction will also be reversed and in case the cardholder 
has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date, 
cashback toward such transactions will be posted to the cardholder's SBI Card account within two

The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder

to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to

finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the

8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.

(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.

(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:

   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399
 - Insurance transactions identified under MCCs 5960, 6300, 6381

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

CASHBACK SBI Card
CASHBACK SBI Card
Q1. How can I earn Cashback?
You can earn Cashback by making online and offline (Point of Sale) transactions using your CASHBACK SBI Card. For details, please see the cardholder T&Cs.
Q2. How much Cashback can I earn?
You can earn card cashback of 5% on online transactions and 1% on offline transactions. For exclusions and other details, please refer the cardholder Terms & Conditions document on sbicard.com
Q3. Is there a limit to the Cashback that I can earn?
Maximum Cashback that can be earned on online and offline spends in a statement cycle will be capped at Rs.5,000. Post reaching the capped limit of Rs.5,000, spends with CASHBACK SBI Card for that statement month will not earn any CASHBACK.
For example: If your statement generation date is 11th July, the transactions posted from 12th June to 11th July will be considered under this statement cycle and all eligible online transactions during this period will accrue 5% Cashback and all eligible offline transactions will accrue 1% Cashback. The maximum card cashback that can be earned cumulative of online and offline spends is Rs. 5,000. Within the same statement period, all transactions posted after reaching the cashback limit of Rs. 5,000 will not accrue any cashback till 11thJuly.
Note: Card Cashback is accrued on posting/settlement date of transaction and not on effective date of transaction and accordingly Card Cashback will get accrued on account as per applicable cashback structure at the time of transaction posting.
Q 4. My cashback for current statement shows negative balance. What does it mean?
Your Cashback will be reversed in case of purchase cancellations, reversals and returns etc. The reversal amount for such transactions will be adjusted/debited in your monthly statement.
For instance: An online transaction posted on 10th June of Rs. 1,00,000 would be eligible for a Card Cashback of 5% i.e. Rs. 5,000, assuming the statement was generated on 11th June. In that case, the Card Cashback of Rs. 5000 will be posted to your account on 13th June.
Suppose on 15th June, you returned the item. Then the cashback of Rs. 5000 will be reversed due to purchase return and the same will be adjusted/debited in your next monthly statement.
Q5. What do I have to do to receive the earned Cashback?
The Card Cashback will be automatically credited to your SBI Card account and will reflect in your monthly statement.
Q6. When will I receive Cashback?
Card Cashback will be automatically credited to your SBI Card account within two working days of the statement generation date.
Q 7. Where can I see the earned Cashback?
You can log in to SBI Card Website or SBI Card Mobile app to check the same.
Q8. Will I earn Card Cashback on fuel spends?
Cashback is not applicable on fuel spends. However, you will receive get1% Fuel Surcharge Waiver across all Petrol Pumps in India on fuel transaction amount ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 3,000. Maximum surcharge waiver of Rs 100 per billing statement, per credit card account is applicable. For further details, please refer the cardholder TnCs.
Q9. What will happen to my Card Cashback if I switch to other SBI credit card?
In case you flip/transfer your CASHBACK SBI Card to another SBI Card, all the Card Cashback earned by you will be automatically posted to your SBI Card account within two working days of the transfer.
Q10. What will happen to my reward points if I transfer to CASHBACK SBI card from any other SBI Card?
In case you flip/transfer your existing credit card to CASHBACK SBI Card, all the reward points accrued and not redeemed on existing card would expire immediately upon flipping / transfer.
Kindly redeem your reward points before you flip/transfer to Cashback SBI Card.
Q11. What will happen to my earned Card Cashback in case of replacement or renewal of my card?
There is no impact on the earned cashback in case of replacement or renewal of your CASHBACK SBI Card
Q12. Will my Card Cashback expire?

B. Cash Advance Fees
The Cardholder can use the Card to access cash in an emergency from domestic/international ATMs. A transaction fee would be levied on all such withdrawals and would be billed to the Cardholder in the next statement. A transaction fee of 2.5% or Rs. 500 whichever is higher at domestic ATMs and 2.5% or Rs. 500, whichever is higher at international ATMs will be levied. The transaction fee is subject to change at the discretion of SBI Cards & Payment Services Private Limited (SBICPSL). All cash advances also carry a finance charge equal to charges on revolving credit (please refer schedule of charges) from the date of withdrawal until the date of full payment.
C. Cash Payment fee
The Cardholders can pay SBI credit card dues at select branches of State Bank of India (SBI) by mentioning their credit card number & amount in pay-in slip and depositing the same at the branch counter. An instant payment acknowledgement receipt will be provided to the cardholder. This facility is available at a service fee of Rs. 250 + applicable taxes. KVB SBI Cardholders can also pay their credit card dues at select branches of Karur Vysya Bank (KVB). No fee is applicable for payment made at Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) branches.
D. Charges
i. Charges and fees, as may be applicable from time to time, are payable by Cardholders for specific services provided by SBICPSL to the Cardholder or for defaults committed by the Cardholder with reference to his Card account
ii. SBICPSL retains the right to alter any charges or fees from time to time or to introduce any new charges or fees, as it may deem appropriate, with due intimation to cardholders.
E. Interest free credit period
The Interest free credit period could range from 20 to 50 days, subject to submission of claims by the merchant. However, ‘Interest free credit period’ is suspended if any balance of the previous month’s bill is outstanding. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of transaction until the date of payment.
F. Finance Charges
Finance Charges are payable at the monthly interest rate on all transactions including unpaid EMI installments from the date of transaction in the event of the Cardholder choosing not to pay his balance in full, and on all cash advances taken by the Cardholder, till they are paid back.
If the Cardholder makes partial or no payment of Total amount due(TAD) before Payment due date(PDD); i.e. the Customer has outstanding balance from previous months and in the current month, full payment of Total amount due is made before Payment due date then Finance charges will be levied on the closing balance till the payment date.
The current rate of finance charges is upto 3.75% per month [45% per annum] from the transaction date and is subject to change at the discretion of SBI Cards & Payment Services Limited (SBICPSL). Finance charges, if payable, are subject to levy of applicable taxes and are debited to the Cardholder’s account till the outstanding on the card is paid in full. The minimum amount of Finance Charge levied on all transactions in the event of the Cardholder choosing not to pay his balance in full within payment due date, and on all cash advances taken by the Cardholder will be Rs 25 each, exclusive of applicable taxes.
a. Finance charges on cash advances are applicable from the date of transaction until the payment is made in full.
Example 1 - Card Statement date – 15th of every month.
Transaction done between 16th June’19 – 15th July’19
1. Retail Purchase of Rs. 5000 – On 20th June’19
2. Cash Withdrawal of Rs. 7000 – On 10th July’19
Assuming No Previous Balance carried forward from the 15th June 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 15th July statement showing Rs.12,000 of transactions along with 6 days of finance charges at the rate applicable on the Rs.7,000 cash withdrawal. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 5th August 2019, i.e., 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. Please note that any payment made against your credit card outstanding will first be cleared against 100% of GST, 100% of EMI amount, 100% of Fees/Charges, 100% of Finance charges, Balance Transfer, Retail Spends and Cash Advance in that order. Finance charges will be levied from the previous statement date unless in the case of non-interest levied outstanding retail balance, where the finance charge is levied from the date of the transaction. In case the statement outstanding has no cash balance and has not been carried forward from a previous statement and the retail balance outstanding on the statement date is paid in full by the payment due date, No Finance Charges are levied on such balances
Example 2 –Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.
Transaction done between 3rd Jan’19 – 2nd Feb’19
1. Retail Purchase of Rs. 10000 – On 5th Jan’19
2. Online Purchase of Rs. 30000 – On 15th Jan’19
Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd Jan 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd Feb statement showing Rs. 40,000 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or the Minimum Amount Due. In case the statement outstanding has no cash balance and has not been carried forward from a previous statement and the retail balance outstanding on the statement date is paid in full by the payment due date, No Finance Charges are levied on such balances.
Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment stretching over the years with consequent interest payment on your outstanding balance. For e.g. on a transaction of Rs. 10,000 if Minimum Amount Due is paid every month (subject to a minimum amount of Rs. 200 every month), it will take up to 52 months for entire outstanding amount to be paid in full.
Example 3 – Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.
Transaction done between 3rd March ‘19 – 2nd April ‘19
(1) Annual fee of Rs. 500 – On 5th March ‘19
(2) Applicable taxes of Rs. 90 – On 5th March ‘19
(3) Online Purchase of Rs. 6000 – On 15th March ‘19
Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd March 2019 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd April statement showing Rs. 6,590 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd April 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. Assuming the cardholder makes the payment of Minimum Amount Due of Rs.710 (100% of GST (Rs 90) + 100% of EMI amount (Rs.0) + 100% of Fee/charges (Rs.500) + 100% of Finance charges (Rs 0) + Overlimit amount (Rs 0) + 2% of Remaining Balance i.e. 2% of Rs. 6,000 (Rs.120) on 22nd April 2019, rounded off to nearest decimal point. Finance charges would be levied at the effective rate and added to the total outstanding. Since the Minimum Amount Due has been paid, yet a balance of the previous month’s bill is outstanding, thus the ‘interest free credit period’ has been suspended. Considering the effective rate of 3.75% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:
On the balance of Rs.6,000 (15th March to 21st April) for 38 days: (3.75*12)*(38/365)*6000/100= Rs.281.10.
On the balance of Rs.5,880 (22nd April to 2nd May) for 11 days: (3.75*12)*(11/365)*5,880/100= Rs.79.74.
Total Interest charged = Rs 360.84.
Sum of Outstanding purchase amount, Interest charges, Fees and Charges, if any, and applicable taxes would reflect as the Total amount due in the statement dated 2nd May assuming the card holder does not make any transactions between 3rd April ‘19 – 2nd May ‘19.
If the Cardholder makes partial or no payment of Total amount due (TAD) before Payment due date (PDD); i.e. the Customer has outstanding balance from previous months and in the current month, full payment of Total amount due is made before Payment due date then Finance charges will be levied on retail spends, cash advance (if any) and finance charge (if any) till the payment date.
Example 4: Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.
Transactions done between 3rd Dec’18 – 2nd Jan’19
1) Retail Purchase of Rs. 500 – On 15th Dec’18
2) Online Purchase of Rs.600 – On 20th Dec’18
Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd December 2018 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd Jan statement showing Rs. 1100 transactions and Total amount due of Rs. 1100. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Jan 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due.
Assuming the cardholder makes partial payment of Rs. 500, on 22nd Jan 2019, finance charges would be levied at the effective rate and added to the total outstanding. Considering the effective rate of 3.75% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:
On the balance of Rs. 500 (15th Dec to 21st Jan) for 38 days: (3.75*12) * (38/365) *500/100 = Rs. 23.42
On the balance of Rs. 600 (20th Dec to 21st Jan) for 33 days: (3.75*12) * (33/365) *600/100 = Rs. 24.41
On the balance of Rs 600(22nd Jan to 2nd Feb) for 12 days: (3.75*12) * (12/365) *600/100 = Rs. 8.88
Total Interest Charged = Rs. 56.71
Transactions done between 3rd Feb’19 – 2nd Mar’19
1) Beginning balance of Rs. 656.71 – On 3rd Feb’19
2) Retail Purchase of Rs. 1000 – On 5th Feb’19
3) Online Purchase of Rs. 3000 – On 15th Feb’19
Assuming previous balance of Rs. 656.71 carried forward from the 2nd Feb 2019 statement, the cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb 2019, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due.
Assuming Cardholder makes complete payment by 15th Feb i.e. within Payment due date. Considering the effective rate of 3.75% p.m., finance charge calculation will be done as follows:
On the Balance of Rs. 656.71 (3rd Feb – 14th Feb) for 12 days:
(3.75*12) *(12/365) * 656.71/100 = Rs. 9.72
Total Interest Charged = Rs. 9.72
Sum of Outstanding purchase amount, Interest charges, Fees and Charges, if any, and all applicable taxes would reflect as the Total amount due in the statement dated 2nd March.
G. Minimum Amount Due Definition:
Minimum Amount Due shall be 100% of GST + 100% of EMI amount + 100% of Fees/Charges +100% of finance charges+ Overlimit Amount (if any) + 2% of remaining balance outstanding.
Payments received against the Cardholder's outstanding will be adjusted against 100% of GST, 100% of EMI amount, 100% of Fees/Charges, 100% of Finance charges, Balance transfer, Retail Spends and Cash Advance in that order.
Example of MAD Calculation:

Example 1 -
Card Statement date – 2nd of every month. Transaction done between 3rd Jan’16 – 2nd Feb’16
(1) Retail Purchase of Rs. 5000 – On 5th Jan’16
(2) Online Purchase of Rs. 5000 – On 15th Jan’16
Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd Jan 2016 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd Feb statement showing Rs. 10,000 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb 2016, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. If the cardholder does not make the payment of the Minimum Amount Due or more by 22nd Feb 2016, he would be charged a Late Payment Charge of Rs. 750 (Rs. 750 for greater than Rs.1000 & up to Rs. 10,000).
Example 2 -
Card Statement date – 2nd of every month. Transaction done between 3rd Feb’16 – 2nd Mar’16
1. Retail Purchase of Rs. 2000 – On 8th Feb’16
2. Online Purchase of Rs. 2500 – On 19th Feb’16
Assuming no previous balance carried forward from the 2nd Feb 2016 statement, the cardholder will get his 2nd March statement showing Rs. 4500 transactions. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd March 2016, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for anything between the entire amount or the Minimum Amount Due. If the cardholder does not make any payment by 22nd March 2016, he would be charged a Late Payment Charge of Rs. 750 (Rs. 750 for greater than Rs.1000 & up to Rs. 10,000)
Example 3- Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.
Transaction done between 3rd Sep – 2nd Oct
(1) Retail Purchase of Rs. 9400 – On 5th Sep
Assuming no previous balance carry forward from the 2nd Sep statement, the card holder will get 2nd Oct statement showing Rs. 9400 as total amount due. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Oct, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for any amount between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. The cardholder makes complete payment of Rs. 9400 against the outstanding on or before 22nd Oct.
Transaction done between 3rd Oct – 2nd Nov
Retail Purchase of Rs. 5000 – On 5th Oct
Online Purchase of Rs. 5000 – On 15th Oct
The card holder will get 2nd Nov statement showing Rs. 10,000 as total amount due. The customer receives a refund of Rs. 9400 for the transaction done in previous cycle from the merchant on 10th Nov. This refund amount will be adjusted against the total amount due. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding on or before 22nd Nov, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for any amount between the outstanding amount or Minimum Amount Due. Since credit amount arising out of refund is greater than Minimum Amount Due, the cardholder will not be charged with Late Payment Charge.
Example 4- Card Statement date – 2nd of every month.
Transaction done between 3rd Jan – 2nd Feb
Retail Purchase of Rs. 4500 – On 5th Jan
Online Purchase of Rs. 6000 – On 15th Jan
The card holder will get 2nd Feb statement showing Rs. 10,500 as total amount due. The cardholder needs to make payment against the outstanding by 22nd Feb, i.e. 20 days from the Statement Date, for any amount between the entire amount or Minimum Amount Due. If the cardholder does not make the payment of the Minimum Amount Due or more on or before 22nd Feb he would be charged a Late Payment Charge of Rs. 950 (Rs. 950 for greater than Rs.10,000 & up to Rs. 25,000).
I. Over Limit Fees
As a service gesture, SBI Card may approve Overlimit transactions subject to internal policy, eligibility with respect to transaction, customer profile and customer consent.

K)SMA & NPA
(A) Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’):
In furtherance to Regulatory requirements, SBI Card is required to identify incipient stress in the account by creating a sub-asset category viz. 'Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’)” with the three sub-categories as given in the table below.
Credit cards are treated as "Loans other than revolving facilities".
SMA Sub-categories
Basis for classification
[Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue]
SMA – 0
Upto 30 days from Payment Due Date (‘PDD’).
SMA – 1
More than 30 days & upto 60 days from PDD
SMA – 2
More than 60 days & upto 90 days from PDD
Example regarding classification of SMA:
If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and “Minimum Amount Due (‘MAD’) are not received before this date then after the due date, the account will be mentioned as SMA – 0.
If the account continues to remain overdue beyond 30 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th April 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA-1. Similarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, beyond 60 days from PDD i.e., beyond 30th May 2021 then this account shall get tagged as SMA – 2.
(B) Non-Performing Asset (NPA):
A credit card account will be treated as non-performing asset (‘NPA’) if the Minimum Amount Due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within ninety (90) days from the PDD mentioned in the statement. Further, any account where a settlement or restructuring arrangement has been availed will be classified as NPA. An account continues to be classified as NPA till the entire arrears of interest and principal are paid. Settlement and restructured accounts do not qualify for an upgrade. Finally, if any customer has even one credit card with SBI Card tagged as NPA, all cards of the customer will be classified as NPA.
Example regarding classification of an account as NPA:
If Payment Due Date (‘PDD’) of a Credit Card account is 31st March 2021, and Minimum Amount Due as mentioned in the statement has not been fully paid by the customer within a period of 90 days from the PDD i.e., till 29th June 2021, then the lender shall consider the credit card account as NPA.
Treatment of EMI benefits / services availed by the cardholder once the account turns NPA:
A day after the statement is generated post account classification as NPA, all EMI plans (excluding hardship plans) available on the account shall be closed and the principal outstanding along with the outstanding interest accrued till the date of such EMI plans shall be debited to the Credit Card Account and appear in the subsequent monthly statement. SBI Card shall be entitled to demand immediate repayment of such consolidated outstanding amounts. As a part of the Credit Card Account, this balance will attract all applicable charges (including finance charges at applicable interest rate) as outlined in the MITC.

Payments
Note: For smooth processing of payment made towards your card outstanding, please avoid using payment modes not advised by SBI Card. To know more about the ways to make payment, please visit
https://sbicard.com/en/personal/pay.page
.
Important Communication on Payment Decline: As per SBI Card internal policy, payments made by customer through any instant channel (NEFT, Visa Money Transfer, MasterCard MoneySend, BBPS, Paynet, Debit Card, EBP or UPI) will be declined if the amount paid is more than the current outstanding. Hence, customers are advised not to make excess payment towards their credit card.
Any payment made toward the card outstanding (through standing instruction or otherwise) will be declined in case the payment amount is more than the maximum permissible limit.
As per SBI Card internal policy, Auto Debit mandate will not be processed if the amount outstanding on a card is less than ₹ 50. Cardholders are advised to make payment using any other digital mode in such cases.
When payment via Auto Debit bounces for any reason, the mandate is put on hold. In such cases, Cardholders are advised to pay the Minimum Amount Due through other modes of payment so that Auto Debit mandate can be processed from the next billing cycle.
If a Cardholder wishes to make payment towards his / her outstanding through any other mode while an Auto Debit mandate is already active on card account, the payment will have to be made 3 days before the Payment Due Date so that the necessary adjustments can be made.
Cardholders are required to maintain adequate balance in their bank account at least one day before the Payment Due Date so that their Auto Debit payment does not bounce due to lack of funds.

to key in your Personal Identification Number (PIN).
• Wait for a few seconds till the machine processes this PIN. It will then ask you to key 
in the amount of cash you need.

Using your CASHBACK SBI Card is very simple. Once you have made a purchase at any 
of the merchant establishments that display the Visa sign, please present your card for 
payment
The establishment will prepare a charge slip (specimen shown above), very much like a 
normal bill, which contains the details of the transaction.
• Please verify the amount  A  and ensure that other particulars on your charge slip 
are correct. 
• Kindly add the amount paid as tips and 
miscellaneous expenses and ensure that 
the total amount is filled. Check the 
amount in words (never leave the total 
blank).
• Please sign on the charge slip at the 
place indicated  B  in the same way as 
you have signed on the reverse of your 
card. You will be returned a copy of the 
charge slip, the actual bill and your 
card. 
• Before you leave, please ensure that 
you have received your card.
• The amount you spend on your card will 
appear in your monthly statement. You 
can make your CASHBACK SBI Card 
payment using any of the 14 payment 
options available. Normal use of card 
does not attract any transaction fee or 
interest charge except in case of late 
payment / no payment.HOW TO USE YOUR CASHBACK SBI Card?

CASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’sCASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’s9

10 CASHBACK SBI Card FAQ’S
Look Wave Go1.  What is CASHBACK SBI Card?
Ans:  CASHBACK SBI Card powered by Visa contactless technology is a fast and con-
venient way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, contactless chip tech-
nology designed to help you spend less time at the cash register and give you the 
freedom to do the things that matter most to you.
2. How does the CASHBACK SBI Card work?
Ans: Step 1: Look for the Visa contactless technology mark and contactless logo at 
the point of sale.
 Step 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into the terminal. This amount 
will be displayed on the contactless reader.
 Step 3: Hold your card over the reader at close range (less than 4 cm from where 
the contactless logo appears).
 Step 4: Four green indicator lights or a beep sound will indicate when the 
transaction is complete. A message will also be displayed on the screen 
indicating the transaction is complete. No PIN is required. 
 Please note that payment through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum 
 of `5000 for a single transaction.
3.  What are the benefits?
Ans: Contactless payment functionality powered by Visa is specially designed for you 
for speed, convenience and security. During a contactless transaction the card 
never leaves your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud 
through counterfeit/ skimming. A Visa contactless card has its own, unique, 
built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a unique code for every Visa 
contactless transaction, thus making it more secure. There’s no dipping, swiping 
or fumbling for cash. You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places 
like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatre etc. You don’t need to look for 
cash/coins for small ticket everyday purchases. It is also easier to keep track of 
these expenses.

11
4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount? Can I set my own limit?
Ans: Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a limit of maximum `5000 
for a single transaction. For a contactless transaction PIN is not required. 
 This limit is common for all customers and setting up of individual limit is not 
possible. Any transaction amount more than `5000 has to be carried out through
 Look, Wave, Go, a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. You 
can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or Swipe) with PIN for 
transactions amount below `5000.
5. Where can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card ?
Ans: You can look for the Universal Contactless symbol at the Point of Sale machine 
at merchant outlets. Also, please visit sbicard.com for details of merchants 
enabled for Visa contactless payment acceptance.
6. Can I use my CASHBACK SBI Card at other merchants (not enabled or contact-
less payment acceptance) as well?
Ans: Yes, for the merchants not enabled for contactless payment acceptance, you can 
use this card for a normal dip or swipe transaction.
7.  Could I be debited twice if I have more than one contactless card?
Ans: No, as contactless readers will only communicate with one card at a time. If the 
shop’s reader finds more than one contactless card in your wallet or purse, you  
will be asked to select one card to pay.
8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk past the reader?
Ans: No. Your card has to be waved within 4 cm of the card reader for more than half 
a second and the retailer must have first entered the amount for you to approve.  
Terminals can only process one payment transaction at a time, therefore 
reducing transaction errors.
9. Is there any difference in the process for ATM and Internet transactions for the 
CASHBACK SBI Card?
Ans: There is no difference in transaction process for ATM or any Card not present 
transactions including internet transactions. For ATM transactions you need to 
enter the PIN and for Internet transaction you need to enter your 3D secure PIN 
or OTP.

16 USE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY
While you are empowered to use your credit card the way you wish to, it is best to use 
it responsibly.  As credit card mismanagement is on the rise various financial institu-
tions in the country have set up CIBIL, a body to monitor credit usage and safeguard 
the interests of member banks and financial institutions. Here is how an ideal credit 
cycle works: 
WHAT IS CREDIT INFORMATION BUREAU INDIA LIMITED (CIBIL)?
CIBIL is India’s first credit information bureau established in 2004. It is a repository of 
information which contains the credit history of all borrowers CIBIL’s members include 
all leading banks, financial institutions,non-banking financial companies, housing 
finance companies, state financial corporations and credit card companies.You borrow

You make
your payments

Ideal Credit Cycle
WHAT IS A CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT?
A Credit Information Report (CIR) is a factual record of a borrower’s credit payment 
history compiled from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose 
is to help Banks & Financial Institutions make informed lending decisions - quickly and 
objectively.
HOW DOES THE CREDIT INFORMATION REPORT IMPACT ME?
When you approach the Banks & Financial Institutions for credit, your application will 
be evaluated on the basis of your past payment history, existing credit lines and other 
factors such as income and security. A good past payment history may lead to credit 
being granted faster and on better terms.
On the other hand, a poor past payment record indicate past delinquency and can lead 
to denial of credit or extremely expensive credit.
Therefore prudent credit management and financial discipline is a must to ensure a 
good credit history for enabling you for smooth and faster access to affordable credit 
in the future.
HOW DO I IMPROVE MY CREDIT RECORD?
• Make at least the minimum amount due on time each month. On time payments will 
have the most positive significant impact on your credit record.
• Maintain affordable & reasonable levels of credit
• Limit the number of credit cards that you hold. Maintaining a large number of cards 
can hurt your credit history.
• Do not use your credit card such that your outstanding is very close to your credit 
limit as this can adversely affect your credit rating.17
DO’S
• Make your credit card payments on time
• Pay off your “Minimum Amount Due” on your card every month
• Contact your creditors if you are having trouble making payments
• Make sure that your monthly account statement is correct
• Read the statements and other material you receive from your credit card company 
carefully
• Deal with companies you know and trust
• Pay attention to late payments, calls or letters from credit agencies, and denied or 
revoked credit. These are all signs that your credit history may be in jeopardy!
DON’TS
• Do not pay late
• Do not sign a credit contract until you read and understand it
• Don’t go over the credit limit on your credit card
• Don’t wait to report any unauthorized transactions on your account
• Don’t open new credit accounts for the purpose of debit consolidation without clos-
ing existing accounts
• Do not miss reviewing your monthly statements
• Do not close credit cards in an improper manner, it can hurt your credit scoreHOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY?

event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

excess immediately. The over limit fee is subject to change at the discretion of SBICPSL. The credit limit 
may be revised from time to time at the discretion of SBICPSL.
3.5 SBICPSL may, at any time without prior notice, refuse authorisation for a Charge incurred at a 
Merchant Establishment, and/or restrict or defer the Cardholder’s ability to use the Card and/or 
suspend or cancel the Card and/or repossess (directly or through a Merchant Establishment or any 
other third party) the Card if it reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for proper management 
of credit or business risk or if the Card or the Card Account is being or likely to be misused or if the 
Cardholder is in violation of the exchange control/management regulations or any other applicable law 
or regulation.
3.6 The Card may be used for personal purposes and for bona fide business expenses.3.7 The Cardholder shall ensure that he/she maintains a detailed record of his/her transactions on the 
Internet. SBICPSL is not obliged to make any independent verification with regard to order details 
provided by the Cardholder and shall be entitled to rely on the details submitted by the Cardholder on 
the Internet.
3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The 
Cardholder must retain his/her own copy of the charge slips. Copies of charge slips will not normally 
be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.

Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the 
concerned Merchant Establishment.

Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount 
recorded on such charge slip or other requisition was properly incurred by the use of the Card by the 
Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.
3.12 You agree that an electronic record or printout of an electronic record or a copy produced from a 
microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account 
with SBICPSL or produced from data received by SBICPSL electronically from the Merchant 
Establishment or from you or any intermediary, shall be conclusive evidence of that document or 
Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.
3.17 The onus of complying with the foreign exchange control/management regulations, baggage rules, 
EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder 
and the Cardholder and shall indemnify and hold harmless SBICPSL from any consequence, loss, 
damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any 
scenario)
 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350
All identification of eligible and non-eligible transactions regarding Card Cashback by SBICPL are on best 
effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion. 
Below categories will not be eligible for Cashback benefit: 
e) Cashback earned for the purchases during the current billing statement month will be credited in 
the next billing statement month on statement generation date plus two days  i.e. if the statement 
date is 15th Feb, cashback earned in the Feb month cycle (16th Jan-15th Feb) will be credited on 
17th Feb. f) Cashback earned will be computed based on spends during the statement period minus any returns 
or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the 
corresponding cashback earned on the transaction will also be reversed and in case the cardholder 
has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date, 
cashback toward such transactions will be posted to the cardholder's SBI Card account within two 
days of the statement generation.
h) In case of conversion of a transaction to EMI at a later date, cashback earned on such transaction 
will be reversed during the same billing statement month as EMI conversion.
i) The cashbacks earned/reversed during a billing statement month will be visible in the monthly

Establishment, by itself may repossess/retain the Credit Card, if it reasonably believes that it is 
necessary to do so for proper management of credit or business risk, or if the Card or Card

s) Card Cashback is not applicable on transactions less than /uni20B9100.
t) SBI Card may temporarily prohibit any cardholder from earning cashback or using any features of

The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

Card and the Cardholder shall be liable to make payment for the Charges within 30 days of incurring 
the Charge on the basis of his/her own record of the transaction or earlier if requested by SBICPSL.

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.

to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject

accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The

overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.

defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.

The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

Cardholder must retain his/her own copy of the charge slips. Copies of charge slips will not normally 
be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.
3.10 In relation to Charges on account of mail order or telephone or electronic commerce (e.g. on the 
Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the 
concerned Merchant Establishment.
3.11 Any charge slip or other payment requisition (electronic or otherwise) received from a Merchant 
Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount 
recorded on such charge slip or other requisition was properly incurred by the use of the Card by the 
Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.
3.12 You agree that an electronic record or printout of an electronic record or a copy produced from a 
microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account 
with SBICPSL or produced from data received by SBICPSL electronically from the Merchant 
Establishment or from you or any intermediary, shall be conclusive evidence of that document or 
Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.
3.17 The onus of complying with the foreign exchange control/management regulations, baggage rules, 
EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder 
and the Cardholder and shall indemnify and hold harmless SBICPSL from any consequence, loss, 
damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

relation to the insurance cover shall be addressed to and resolved directly by the Cardholder with the

reason, the benefit of such insurance cover shall automatically and ipso facto cease to be available 
from the date of suspension/cancellation of the Card Account.

nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

the Charge on the basis of his/her own record of the transaction or earlier if requested by SBICPSL.

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350
All identification of eligible and non-eligible transactions regarding Card Cashback by SBICPL are on best 
effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion. 
Below categories will not be eligible for Cashback benefit: 
e) Cashback earned for the purchases during the current billing statement month will be credited in 
the next billing statement month on statement generation date plus two days  i.e. if the statement 
date is 15th Feb, cashback earned in the Feb month cycle (16th Jan-15th Feb) will be credited on 
17th Feb. f) Cashback earned will be computed based on spends during the statement period minus any returns 
or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the 
corresponding cashback earned on the transaction will also be reversed and in case the cardholder 
has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date, 
cashback toward such transactions will be posted to the cardholder's SBI Card account within two 
days of the statement generation.
h) In case of conversion of a transaction to EMI at a later date, cashback earned on such transaction 
will be reversed during the same billing statement month as EMI conversion.
i) The cashbacks earned/reversed during a billing statement month will be visible in the monthly 
credit card billing statement.
j) Maximum Card Cashback that can be earned on online and offline spends in a statement cycle is 
capped at ₹5000. Post reaching the capping limit, cardholder will not earn any cashback for that

or SBI Card, the primary Cardholder will forthwith be disqualified from earning the cashback and all 
the Card Cashback not posted to the Cardholder's SBI Card account shall automatically be forfeited 
immediately after voluntary or involuntary cancellation of the CASHBACK SBI Card.
l) The SBI Card must not be overdue, suspended, blocked, cancelled or terminated by SBICPSL at the 
time of the posting of the Card Cashback in the Cardholder's SBI Card account.
m) The Card Cashback accrued will be credited in the Primary Cardholder’s account, and not in the

reward points accrued and not redeemed on such variant would expire immediately upon such 
flipping / transfer. All reward points are required to be redeemed prior to transferring / flipping  to

o) The Credit Card is issued for personal expenses and purposes only. The Cardholder must not use 
the Credit Card to purchase anything for resale, for commercial or business purposes. The Credit 
Card should be used only for lawful, bona fide personal purposes and must not be used for any

business (e.g. for working capital purposes).
p) If the Credit Card is found to be used for prohibited, restricted, commercial purposes or any 
purposes as mentioned above, SBI Card may, at its sole discretion, exercise its right to cancel the 
concerned Credit Card and additional/add-on cards thereof and withhold/cancel the Cashback 
earned, without any notice to the Cardholder. SBI Card may enquire with cardholder over phone or 
through any other means of formal communication and seek details, information, proofs, etc., 
about the Credit Card transactions, pattern of usage, etc. Non- satisfactory responses or no 
responses from the Cardholder may lead to blocking/closure of the Credit Card by SBI Card.
q) Use of the Card at Merchant Establishment will be limited by the credit limit assigned to each Card Account.
r) SBI Card may, at any time without prior notice, or stating any reason whatsoever, refuse 
authorization for a Charge at a Merchant Establishment, and/or restrict or defer the Card member's 
ability to use the Card and/or suspend or cancel the Card. SBI Card through the ATM, Merchant 
Establishment, by itself may repossess/retain the Credit Card, if it reasonably believes that it is 
necessary to do so for proper management of credit or business risk, or if the Card or Card 
Account is being misused or likely to be misused.
s) Card Cashback is not applicable on transactions less than /uni20B9100.
t) SBI Card may temporarily prohibit any cardholder from earning cashback or using any features of 
the program basis its internal policies and requirements.
u) Since there is no cashback on EMI transactions, once a transaction is converted in to EMI, the

or cancellation of the EMI and pays the full amount on the same.
v) The Card Cashback will be rounded down for each individual transaction. For e.g., for an eligible 
online transaction of /uni20B92,999, the 5% Card Cashback would be calculated as following: 
 5% Card Cashback= ₹2,999 * 5% = ₹149 (rounded down from ₹149.95)

finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account

be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

the Charge on the basis of his/her own record of the transaction or earlier if requested by SBICPSL.

any credit received from the Merchant Establishments in favour of the Cardholder. When the Card 
Account has a debit(s) or a credit(s) to be applied over a statement period as determined by SBICPSL 
from time to time, SBICPSL will send a monthly statement of account to the Cardholder reflecting such 
debit(s)/credit(s). The Cardholder’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement will not be 
affected in any way by non-receipt of the monthly statement of account and the Cardholder shall be

noting, record or any other evidence (electronic or otherwise) of the Charge.

period will apply if the Outstanding balance on the Card Account for the previous statement period 
(if any) is paid in full by its due date. If the Outstanding balance on the Card Account is not paid in

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The

copies thereof subject to an additional charge.

Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly

statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.

Charge for any purpose.

to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.

Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by

Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.

suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder.

privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the

the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.

maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - Merchant EMI i.e. EMI’s availed at the time of purchase at Merchant establishment or websites. 
(Card Cashback reversed for Flexipay/Merchant EMI will be credited back to account only when 
the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are 
subject to change basis network discretion.

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by 
him/her from other companies and financial institutions. Balance Transfers will not be accepted from 
overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder.

privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.

The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder

damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.
4. CASH ADVANCES
 The Cardholder may be permitted to obtain a Cash Advance from designated branches of State Bank 
of India, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and/or other permitted establishments subject to 
applicable terms and requirements imposed by SBICPSL from time to time. A minimum and/or 
maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.
5. INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1 Insurance is optional and a subject matter of solicitation. In the event any insurance cover or benefit 
of any insurance cover is made available to the Cardholder by an insurance company at the request of 
SBICPSL, the Cardholder specifically acknowledges that SBICPSL will not be liable in any manner 
whatsoever and that the insurance company will be solely liable for all claims thereunder. The 
Cardholder shall not hold SBICPSL responsible for any matter arising out of or in connection with such insurance cover, whether for or in respect of any deficiency or defect in such insurance cover.

from the date of suspension/cancellation of the Card Account.

nominees, beneficiaries, etc., under the insurance policy.

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

 - Payments towards Rent/property management under MCCs 6513 and 7349
 - Jewelry transactions identified under MCCs 5051, 5094, 7631, 5944
 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

or regulation.

the Internet.
3.8 Some transactions may attract a service charge, in addition to the amount of the Charge, at certain 
Merchant Establishments. SBICPSL may also levy charges for collection of cheques, maintenance of the 
Card Accounts, and for other services that may be rendered to the Cardholder from time to time.
3.9 The Cardholder must sign and collect the Charge slip, Cash Advance Slip or Mail Order Coupon at the 
time of incurring the Charge. Failure to sign a charge slip will not avoid liability for the Charges. The

be provided by SBICPSL. However, at its discretion, and upon customer request, SBICPSL may provide 
copies thereof subject to an additional charge.

Internet) where a charge slip or voucher may not be available for signature, the Cardholder accepts that 
in the event of any dispute regarding the authenticity or validity of such a Charge, the Cardholder will 
first clear his/her Outstanding on the Card and then endeavour to resolve the dispute directly with the

Establishment or any intermediary by SBICPSL for payment shall be conclusive proof that the amount

Cardholder. Should the Cardholder choose to disagree with a Charge indicated in the monthly 
statement of account, the same should be communicated to SBICPSL within 10 (ten) days of the 
statement date, failing which it would be construed that all Charges and the monthly statement of 
account are entirely in order.

microfilm or a scanned /digital image of any document or Charge relating to your Card / Card Account

Charge for any purpose.
3.13 SBICPSL will not be responsible if any Merchant Establishment refuses to accept the Card or is unable 
to transact on the Card or levies a surcharge on the Card. However, the Cardholder should notify 
SBICPSL of this complaint. SBICPSL is not responsible or liable for any defect or deficiency in respect 
of goods and services charged to the Card. Any dispute should be settled directly by the Cardholder 
with the Merchant Establishment and failure to do so will not relieve the Cardholder of any obligations 
to SBICPSL. The existence of a claim or dispute shall not relieve the Cardholder of his/her obligation to 
pay all Charges and the Cardholder agrees to pay promptly such Charges, notwithstanding any dispute 
or claim whatsoever. No claim by the Cardholder against a Merchant Establishment will be the subject 
of a set-off or counterclaim against SBICPSL.
3.14 SBICPSL may, at its sole discretion, permit from time to time, its Cardholder to transfer his/her 
Outstanding balances (“Balance Transfer/s”) on other credit cards and credit facilities availed by

overdue status accounts or where the credit limit has been exceeded or which are greater than the 
Outstanding balances on such other credit cards and will be limited to such percentage of the available 
credit limit on the Card as may be determined by SBICPSL. Balance Transfer requests will also not be 
accepted from other CASHBACK SBI Card  accounts. By choosing to avail of the Balance Transfer facility, the Cardholder authorizes SBICPSL to make payments to companies/financial institutions so 
designated. SBICPSL, however, reserves its absolute right to refuse any Balance Transfer request. The 
Cardholder must continue to meet his/her obligations in respect of his/her existing credit facilities, 
balances of which are the subject of Transfer hereunder, until he/she has received a written intimation 
from SBICPSL that the Balance Transfer request has been accepted and payments have been made to 
the companies/financial institutions so designated. SBICPSL will not be liable for any new charges, 
overdue payments or interests incurred on other credit cards/facilities. SBICPSL may, in its discretion, 
stipulate additional terms and conditions from time to time.
3.15 The Cardholder acknowledges that the privileges, benefits and facilities attached to the Card may be 
suspended/withdrawn by SBICPSL at its discretion at any time without liability to the Cardholder. 
Termination of this Cardholder Agreement shall result automatically in the termination of such 
privileges, benefits and facilities. SBICPSL shall not be liable in any way to the Cardholder for any 
defect or deficiency in any privileges, benefits or facilities provided by third party suppliers or 
Merchant Establishments.
3.16 A purchase and a cancellation of goods/services, e.g. air/rail tickets, are two separate transactions. 
The Cardholder must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears on the statement to avoid incurring 
finance charges or fees. Credit of refund on account of cancellation will be made to the Card Account 
(less cancellation charges) only when received from the Merchant Establishment. No cash refund will 
be given to the Cardholder. If a credit is not posted to the Card Account within a reasonable time, the 
Cardholder must notify SBICPSL within 30 (thirty) days of cancellation.

EXIM Policy and other applicable laws, as amended from time to time, is solely that of the Cardholder

damage, expense or any other financial charge that SBICPSL may incur and/or suffer on account of the 
Cardholder’s contravention of any applicable law and regulation. Non-compliance with the regulations 
shall not be a ground for the Cardholder to delay or refuse the amounts payable to SBICPSL. In case 
the Card is suspended/cancelled, whether on account of non-compliance with exchange 
control/management regulations or otherwise, SBICPSL will not be responsible for any attempted 
usage of the Card, whether in India or abroad, resulting in the Card being dishonoured and the 
concerned Merchant Establishment would be entitled to pick up the Card on presentation.

maximum amount of Cash Advance that can be accessed on the Card in a single charge or in a single 
business day may be specified by SBICPSL periodically. The total amount that will be available for cash 
withdrawal at any point in time will be governed by cash limits set up periodically which will be 
disclosed to the Cardholder in the monthly statement of account. A cash advance fee will be levied on 
each such Charge and will be billed to the Cardholder.

8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399
 - Insurance transactions identified under MCCs 5960, 6300, 6381

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.

(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the 
schedule of charges defined in the Most Important Terms and Conditions.
g) In case the purchase/transaction is returned/cancelled/reversed post statement generation date,

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

effort basis and may be subject to technical limitations. Further, MCCs are defined by network and are

or refunds during the same period. In case the cardholder reverses a transaction, the

has an outstanding balance on credit card in the form of reversed cashback, the same will be 
treated as an ordinary outstanding balance and the customer will be liable to pay for such 
outstanding amount, failing which the said amount will attract the fees & charges as per the

 - School and Educational Services transactions identified under MCCs 5111, 5192, 5942, 5943, 
8211, 8220, 8241, 8244, 8249, 8299, 8351 
 - Utility transactions identified under MCCs 4900, 4814, 4816, 4899, 9399
 - Insurance transactions identified under MCCs 5960, 6300, 6381

the respective Flexipay/Merchant EMI has been successfully cancelled by the cardholder. In the 
event of Foreclosure of Flexipay/Merchant EMI, no Card Cashback will be credited back in any

 - For instance, if the Cardholder spends 45,000 in a billing statement month with the following 
break up of spends. 
   Online spends: /uni20B935,000 | Offline spends: /uni20B910,000
   Of the said Online Spends, /uni20B910,000 was an EMI purchase.
   Thus, the total spends eligible for cashback would only be /uni20B910,000 + /uni20B935,000 – /uni20B910,000   
(EMI transaction) = /uni20B935,000. The cashback for the billing statement month in example would be 
calculated as follows:
   5% of ₹25,000 = ₹1,250
   1% of /uni20B910,000 = /uni20B9100
Thus, the total cashback for the example would be /uni20B91250+100 = /uni20B91,350

Contactless Credit Card FAQs
1. What is a Contactless Credit Card? 
 Contactless Credit Card powered by VISA 
payWave/RuPay Contactless is a fast and convenient 
way to pay for every day purchases. It is a secure, 
contactless chip technology designed to help you spend 
less time at the cash register and give you the freedom 
to do the things that matter most to you. 
2. How does the Contactless Credit Card work? 
 Step 1: Look for the VISA payWave/RuPay Contactless 
mark and contactless logo at the point of sale. 
 Step 2: The cashier enters your purchase amount into 
the terminal. This amount will be displayed on the

3. What are the benefits? 
 Contactless payment functionality powered by VISA 
payWave/RuPay Contactless is specially designed for 
you for speed, convenience and security. There’s no 
dipping, swiping, entering PIN or fumbling for cash. 
You’re ready to go in just a few seconds. Ideal for places 
like fast-food joints, petrol stations, movie theatres etc. 
 During a contactless transaction the card never leaves 
your hand. This greatly reduces the risk of card loss and 
fraud through counterfeit/skimming. 
A VISA payWave/RuPay Contactless card has its own, 
unique, built-in, secret key, which is used to generate a 
unique code for every VISA payWave/RuPay Contactless 
transaction, thus making it more secure. You don’t need 
to look for cash/coins for small ticket everyday 
purchases. It is also easier to keep track of these 
expenses. 
4. Is there a limit for a contactless transaction amount?  
 Can I set my own Limit? 
 Payment through the contactless mode is allowed for a maximum of `5,000 for a single transaction. For a 
contactless transaction PIN is not required. This limit is 
common for all customers and setting up of individual 
limits is not possible. Any transaction amount more than 
`5,000 has to be carried out through a contact 
transaction (Dip or Swipe) and entering the PIN. 
You can also choose to do a contact transaction (Dip or 
Swipe) with PIN for transactions amount below `5,000.

payment acceptance, you can use this card for a normal

 contactless card?

time. If the shop’s reader finds more than one 
contactless card in your wallet or purse, you will be 
asked to select one card to pay. 
8. Could I unknowingly have made a purchase if I walk  
 past the reader?

reader for more than half a second and the retailer must 
enter the amount for you to approve. Terminals can only 
process one payment transaction at a time, therefore 
reducing transaction errors.

 Internet transactions for this contactless Credit Card?
